Profile:

I am a confident and reliable IT Engineer with a valid enhanced DBS, boasting practical experience across various IT domains. My expertise extends to hardware break-fix support, where I've successfully resolved numerous issues. As a MacOS Certified ACSP 10.13 professional, I possess a keen eye for detail and a penchant for problem-solving.

Moreover, I am undergoing a Software Engineering BootCamp to further enhance my skills and keep pace with industry advancements. My experience as a deployment engineer encompasses Windows Server, Casper/Jamf, AWS, O365, and MS Exchange, allowing me to provide comprehensive 1st, 2nd, and 3rd line support.

I excel in communication, facilitating effective interactions with stakeholders at all levels, including management, suppliers, and clients. My ability to adhere to predefined workflows ensures that deadlines are consistently met in accordance with service level agreements. While I thrive in team environments, I am equally adept at delivering results independently.

With a proactive approach to ICT and a passion for continuous learning, I am poised to make significant contributions to any ambitious and expanding company. I am eager to leverage my skills and drive to further my career in a dynamic and growth-oriented environment.
